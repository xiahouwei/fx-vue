 * handle updates explicitly marked by these patch flags.
 *
 * Patch flags can be combined using the | bitwise operator and can be checked
 * using the & operator, e.g.
 *
 * ```js
 * const flag = TEXT | CLASS
 * if (flag & TEXT) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Check the `patchElement` function in '../../runtime-core/src/renderer.ts' to see how the
